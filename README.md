### Components
#### Web

  - Reports errors
  - renders pages
  - provides API
- Manages application state
  - Establishes database connections
  - Binds ports
  - Spawn background tasks
- Has no direct access to data layer/component. It must go through the Service component to get data.

#### Service
- Intermediate layer between web requests and database.
  - can communicate with web and data components.
  - can't communicate with clients
- Abstracts user requests and data access
- Implements core application logic

#### Database
- Manages data storage and retrieval
- Works directly with database
- No logic: only queries (no modification on ingoing/outgoing data)\
- Can only communicate with service component

#### Domain
- Data types shared across components
- Enforces business rules on data
  - Domain objects cannot be created unless all rules satisfied
